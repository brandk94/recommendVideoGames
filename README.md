  <h1>Video Game Recommendation Program</h1>
  <strong>A Portfolio Project for Codecademy</strong>
</div>

## Project Description
This project will create a basic recommendation program that searchs for and retrieves 
video game titles for a user, based on input they type to the program's interface.

## Features and Tools Used
* Key-Value dictionaries will be used to store video game titles and the categories and characteristics they each fall under.
* Python will be the programming language to build and run the program.
* An effective data structure (e.g. Linked Lists) will store and display specific video game titles that the program retrieves from a search iteration.
* The program will ask a user specific questions about what videos games they are looking for.
* A digital cart will allow a user to select video game titles for a potential check-out.
